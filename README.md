### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where an elder teaches a child the true name of a local plant or animal, and the consequence of forgetting it.
- Draft a council meeting in Mercy where a character must translate the concept of 'land as a library' to skeptical townspeople focused on jobs.
- Create a journal entry from Dr. Vance's perspective after her first encounter with Kai, revealing a hidden doubt or a buried memory of nature.
- Write a myth or 'teaching story' from the novel's world about the first time the machines spoke and the land fell silent.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'Living Map' interface that layers ecological data (animal paths, plant cycles, water flow) over a standard surveyor's grid, visualizing the conflict.
- Prototype an audio tool that analyzes environmental soundscapes, identifying the 'health score' based on the presence or absence of key natural and industrial sounds.
